## Link to the CTF: tryhackme.com/jr/cybrosctf

This is a mini blog about the steps I took into making my first CTF. If possible, I would love it if you played and shared my CTF! Additionally, I'm all ears for criticism and possible improvements to implement into my next CTF. Thanks!

### Phase One: Ideas

This phase was really the simplest one out of all of them. When I realized that making a CTF was more than possible for someone of my skill level, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I don’t want to spoil what is in the CTF incase anyone reading this blog plans on trying the CTF for themselves, but I aimed for something very beginner friendly, yet still fun for more experienced hackers. I knew that there would little to no complexity and I aimed for the box to be as straightforward as possible, with no confusion. Overall, the CTF takes about 3-4 steps in total. I found that this is a solid balance so the player doesn’t feel too overwhelmed, and feels like they’re actually getting somewhere with each step. Of course, I didn’t include any rabbit holes, simply because it’s really frustrating when I’m doing a CTF and I go down a rabbit hole — it is just a waste of time in my eyes. Once I got a solid framework in my mind, I was confident in moving onto the next step.

### Phase two: Ubuntu

This is the phase where I was actually on the command line building the Ubuntu server and implementing the vulnerabilities I had in mind. I really didn’t know what to expect from this phase because outside of basic Linux commands and Kali Linux, I never really MADE anything in Linux. Thankfully, there was a Medium article out there that helped me immensely called *How to make our own CTF Challenge with ease.* by Akshat Gupta. The article did a great job of breaking down the steps of creating the server and implementing adjacent technologies necessary for creating a CTF. With an idea, dedication, and the steps to make a CTF all in my mind, I was ready to move to the next step!

### Phase three: Problems

Naturally, being the inexperienced cybersecurity beginner that I am, I expected everything to go smoothly without any hiccups. Of course, this was not the case. I ran into many small problems, such as a config file having 1 line misconfigured, or even the server just completely crashing out of nowhere. But after three days of work and testing, I was ready to upload my work to TryHackMe and test it out there. As you may have guessed, this process was not as simple as it sounded! I had quite the revalation when I realized that THM only supports up to Ubuntu 20.04, while I did all the work on an Ubuntu 24.04. This was a blessing in disguise, as I was able to get more repetitions in with configuring the server. Additionally, I added more functionality and complexity within the challenge itself. I had to do this uploading & revising process a total of four times due to unforeseen hiccups, or me just wanting to add more to the CTF. Overall, I think that the minor problems I had were well worth the repetition and valuable knowledge I gained through the process. 

### Phase four: Publication

Finally, when I was happy with the finished CTF, I moved onto transforming it into a TryHackMe room, for other users to play and learn. This was one of my more favorite parts, because I was able to format the questions the way I wanted. I used the questions as both a challenge, and a guide. If a player is stuck, they can refer to the questions and it will point them in the right direction, without giving the challenge away too much. A lot of rooms on THM don’t have these types of questions, and I think that by implementing more learning base questions, beginners can learn the commands/scripts themselves, but also the WHY behind it all-which is the most important part. Understanding WHY command X works, but command Y doesn’t and the thought process behind everything. Explaining that entire process through questions can be difficult, but I think I did a solid job.

So here we are! The room is complete, but I am still waiting on THM to review and publish it to all of the website’s users. For now, if you would like to play my CTF, here is the link: [tryhackme.com/jr/cybrosctf](http://tryhackme.com/jr/cybrosctf)

Of course, all feedback is welcome and very appreciated. I really enjoyed making this CTF and as I personally advance in my offensive security journey, I plan to make more CTFs reflecting all the methods I have learned.

If you made it this far, thank you! I hope everyone has a day, and Happy Hacking!
