# Projects Folder

Welcome to my projects folder! This is where I keep all my coding endeavors and experiments.

## About Me

I'm Noah, a college student majoring in cybersecurity. I'm passionate about emerging technologies like AI and always eager to learn new tools and techniques in the field. Outside of technology, I'm also interested in self-improvement, mental and physical health, and maximizing productivity. I'm constantly exploring new study techniques and productivity hacks to optimize my learning process (which I'm definitely going to be focusing on for future projects!)
