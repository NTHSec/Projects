# Projects Folder

Welcome to my projects folder! This is where I keep all my coding endeavors and experiments.

## About Me

I'm Noah, a college student majoring in cybersecurity. I'm passionate about emerging technologies like AI and always eager to learn new tools and techniques in the field. Outside of technology, I'm also interested in self-improvement, mental and physical health, and maximizing productivity. I'm constantly exploring new study techniques and productivity hacks to optimize my learning process (which I'm definitely going to be focusing on for future projects!) 

## Projects

### Notion Image Downloader

This project is a simple tool that extracts images from a Notion page and downloads them to your local machine. It's useful for organizing and managing images stored in Notion.


### Lazy Recon Script

This project is an incredibly basic bash script that automatically scans a target with recon tools such as nmap and gobuster. This project was meant to get my feet wet with bash scripting, so there isn't anything too complex in this one!


### Creating My First CTF

This project involved creating a CTF challenge from scratch, starting with conceptualization, then moving on to deployment of the challenge on an Ubuntu server. Despite encountering various hurdles along the way, the experience was immensely fulfilling, and the resulting CTF aims to provide both beginner-friendly entry points and engaging challenges for experienced hackers.
